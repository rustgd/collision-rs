//! Computer graphics-centric math.
//!
//! This crate provides useful mathematical primitives and operations on them.
//! It is organized into one module per primitive. The core structures are
//! vectors and matrices. A strongly-typed interface is provided, to prevent
//! mixing units or violating mathematical invariants.
//!
//! Transformations are not usually done directly on matrices, but go through
//! transformation objects that can be converted to matrices. Rotations go
//! through the `Basis` types, which are guaranteed to be orthogonal matrices.
//! Despite this, one can directly create a limited rotation matrix using the
//! `look_at`, `from_angle`, `from_euler`, and `from_axis_angle` methods.
//! These are provided for convenience.
